```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Issues

*  tabPanel('Statistical Tests',includeHTML(here('html','Statistical_Test_FlowCharts.html'))) hangs


## Resolved Issues

*  Rendering RMD documents with code blocks show the code blocks without results.

    *  IncludeMarkdown("file.rmd") is processed as a markdown package which transforms it into HTML.  It is not an .Rmd file and the code is not executed by knitr.

*  Rendering HTML generated from a RMD document does not process r code blocks.  The 
    
    Examples  
    
    *  ui:tabPanel('html', uiOutput('html'))
    *  servier:includeHTML(here('html','Statistical_Test_FlowCharts.html'))
    
    Resolution
    1.  Snip the graphic and save it in the images folder.
    2.  set the r block options: results='hide', echo = FALSE
    3.  Add a link to the image. `![](../images/imagename.PNG)`
